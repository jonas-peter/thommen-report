	abstract = {Objectives: Dental implants are widely used to restore function and appearance. It may be essential to choose the appropriate drilling protocol and implant design in order to optimise primary stability. This could be achieved based on an assessment of the implantation site with respect to bone quality and objective biomechanical descriptors such as stiﬀness and strength of the bone-implant system. The aim of this ex vivo study is to relate these descriptors with bone quality, with a pre-implantation indicator of implant stability: pilot-hole drilling force (Fdrilling), and with two post-implantation indicators: maximal implantation torque (Timplantation) and resonance frequency analysis (RFA).
Methods: Eighty trabecular bone specimens were cored from human vertebrae and bovine tibiae. Bone volume fraction (BV/TV), a representative for bone quality, was obtained through micro-computed tomography scans. Implants were kept in controlled laboratory conditions following standard surgical procedures. Forces and torques were recorded and RFA was assessed after implantation. Oﬀ-axis compression tests were conducted on the implants until failure. Implant stability was identiﬁed by stiﬀness and ultimate force (Fultimate). The relationships between BV/TV, Stiﬀness, Fultimate and Fdrilling, Timplantation, RFA were established.
Results: Fdrilling correlated well with BV/TV of the implantation site (r2 = 0.81), stiﬀness (r2 = 0.75) and Fultimate (r2 = 0.80). Timplantation correlated better with stiﬀness (r2 = 0.86) and Fultimate (r2 = 0.94) than RFA (r2 = 0.77 and r2 = 0.74, respectively).
Conclusion: Our results indicate that BV/TV and bone-implant stability can be directly estimated by the force needed for the pilot drilling that occurs during the site preparation before implantation. Moreover, implantation torque outperforms RFA for evaluating the mechanical competence of the bone-implant system.},

	abstract = {Prediction of primary stability is a major challenge in the surgical planning of dental and orthopedic implants. Computational methods become attractive to estimate primary stability from clinical CT images, but implicit finite element analysis of implant press-fit faces convergence issues due to contact and highly distorted elements. This study aims to develop and validate an explicit finite element method to simulate the insertion and primary stability of a rigid implant in a deformable bone while accounting for damage occurring at the bone-implant interface. Accordingly, a press-fit experiment of a conical implant into predrilled bovine trabecular bone was designed and realized for six samples. A displacement-driven cyclic protocol was used to quantify the reaction force and stiffness of the bone-implant system. Homogenized finite element analyses of the experiments were performed by modeling contact with friction and converting an existing constitutive model with elasto-plasticity and damage of bone tissue to be applicable to an explicit time integration scheme where highly distorted elements get deleted. The computed reaction forces and unloading stiffnesses showed high correlations (R2 = 0.95 and R2 = 0.94) with the experiment. Friction between bone and implant exhibited a strong influence on both reaction force and stiffness. In conclusion, the developed explicit finite element approach with frictional contact and element deletion accounts properly for bone damage during press-fit and will help optimizing dental or orthopedic implant design towards maximal primary stability.},

	abstract = {Stability of an implant is defined by its ability to undergo physiological loading–unloading cycles without showing excessive tissue damage and micromotions at the interface. Distinction is usually made between the immediate primary stability and the long-term, secondary stability resulting from the biological healing process. The aim of this research is to numerically investigate the effect of initial implantation press-fit, bone yielding, densification and friction at the interface on the primary stability of a simple bone–implant system subjected to loading–unloading cycles. In order to achieve this goal, human trabecular bone was modeled as a continuous, elasto-plastic tissue with damage and densification, which material constants depend on bone volume fraction and fabric. Implantation press-fit related damage in the bone was simulated by expanding the drilled hole to the outer contour of the implant. The bone–implant interface was then modeled with unilateral contact with friction. The implant was modeled as a rigid body and was subjected to increasing off-axis loading cycles. This modeling approach is able to capture the experimentally observed primary stability in terms of initial stiffness, ultimate force and progression of damage. In addition, it is able to quantify the micromotions around the implant relevant for bone healing and osseointegration. In conclusion, the computationally efficient modeling approach used in this study provides a realistic structural response of the bone–implant interface and represents a powerful tool to explore implant design, implantation press-fit and the resulting risk of implant failure under physiological loading.},

	abstract = {Over 12 million dental implants are placed annually worldwide with a success of 97 \%. The desire arises to allow immediate implant loading which requires an optimal surgery resulting in a high primary implant stability. This necessitates an intra-operative evaluation of bone quality, currently based on clinician experience, and of the bone-implant compound stability, commonly realized by resonance frequency analysis (resonance frequency analysis (RFA)). A subjective assessment of bone quality is highly questionable and needs to be replaced by an objective criterion. The decision for immediate loading requires then a reliable intra-operative prediction of the bone-implant compound stability. Therefore, the goals of this thesis are to (i) develop an experimental gold standard for assessment of implant stability; (ii) propose an objective surrogate of bone quality measurable during a standard surgical procedure; (iii) identify the best intra-operative indicators of bone-implant compound stiﬀness and strength.},

	abstract = {Teeth play an essential role in our ability to speak and eat and arguably a ect an individual's attractivity. Dental implants are designed to assume the function of teeth, so if our teeth get damaged to the point of losing their function, they can be replaced. In order to perform optimally, implants require su cient stability. Implant stability is split between primary stability and secondary stability. Primary stability is the strength of the bone present at the time of implantation and decreases with time. Secondary stability is the strength of the bone-implant system after osseointegraton, taking over as the primary stability decreases. With the clinical trend to strive to allow immediate loading, a high primary implant stability has become essential to reduce the resting period after implantation.},
